                Greetings, my name is Andrew Tocchi and this is my personal bio. To the left you will see a wonderful image of my dog Dalton. Off the bat, I did not name him that was his name already. I apologize, everything after this is essentially going to be a reformatted resume. ENJOY! I have a great interest in technology, it spans the gap between things like SDR to simple networking and website design. I enjoy learning and growing when it comes to emerging tech or new fields of study. I take great pride in my ability to troubleshoot complex issues and to makes sense of chaos.
            </p>
            <p>
                I recieved two bachelors degrees from UC Berkeley, one in Art Practice and the other in Medieval History. I worked as an educator for several years and then worked as a buisness techinican for a major ISP. Nowadays I am working as an IT Sysadmin in the Transit Industry, and greatly enjoy the large scope of my work. I am constantly learning on the job and in my daily life and I never turn down a chance to expand my wealth of knowledge. 
            </p>
            <P>
                I have worked with a variety of different tech systems. I have worked with SDR when assessing the intergity of vast stretches of coax cable. I have worked with network diagnostic tools like wirehark as well as linux based tool kits. I have exeperience troubleshooting advanced VoIP issues, from physical PBX issues to SIP trunk failures. I have not only worked on as-builts for complex network layouts, but have personally routed, wallfished, and strung physical cables of every variety.
